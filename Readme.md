## üöÄ Features

- **Diverse Projects**: A variety of image processing projects ranging from basic transformations to advanced techniques.
- **Algorithm Implementations**: Includes implementations for:
  - Image filtering (blur, sharpen, etc.)
  - Edge detection (Sobel, Canny, etc.)
  - Thresholding (binary, adaptive, Otsu's method)
  - Morphological operations (erosion, dilation, etc.)
- **Well-Structured Code**: Easy-to-follow code with modular implementations.
- **Customization**: Flexible parameters for adjusting algorithm behavior.
